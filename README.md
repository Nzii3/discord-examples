# discord-examples
Discord Bot examples using the latest version of Pycord (discord.py v2 fork).
This repo is mainly for people in the beginners-intermediate zone of using 3rd party libraries in python `(YOU SHOULD KNOW PYTHON BEFORE STARTING A LIBRARY LIKE THIS)`

# Credits
You may use content in these python files to your needs.

I (`vNziie--#7777`) plan to create at least 1 new file a week containing an example until I run out of ideas. I will also provide examples of new features (such as the new release of `discord.ui.Modal`) in an `/examples/views` directory.

# Running your bot

Once you've made your main.py file, inserted your `TOKEN` in your main.py file - and you're using Visual Studio Code - press the green arrow button on the top right of your VSC.

If this doesn't work, try running: `python3 main.py`.

**If none of these work, [create an issue for help](https://github.com/Nzii3/discord-examples/issues/new/choose) or, try going to the [Pycord Support server](https://discord.gg/pycord).**
