# I would COMPLETELY recommend subclassing EVERYTHING from the "message component family" (buttons, selects, context menus, modals, etc). 
# The reason for this is because you can handle the callback easier, use the views persistently (check main.py for more info)
# AND: you can do something with handling the 'interaction_check' event (to see if the author is the author of the message)
#  - With the interaction_check, ill show you my way to compare user objects to see who's the author or not while not having to pass in 'ctx' as you might not have access to it in every situation (e.g. events)
# While subclassing, you can also handle the 'on_timeout' event, this will occur when the view times out '...(timeout=float)'
# You won't find examples of non-subclassed views as it's not recommended by anyone

class Confirm(discord.ui.View): # CREDIT (VERY USEFUL): https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord/blob/master/examples/views/confirm.py
  def __init__(self, author: discord.User):
    self.author = author # this is what you will set when defining the view in your other code: this user object that is the person that invoked the command or event and that person will be the only one confirming/canceling
    super().__init__(timeout=30) # you can edit this to whatever you want in SECONDS
    self.value = None
    # THIS EXAMPLE IS TAKEN FROM THE PY-CORD EXAMPLES: BUT EDITED TO MY PERFERENCE
    # AS THEN YOU CAN DO:
    # view = Confirm(author=myauthorobject)
    # await view.wait()
    # if view.value == "Yes":
    # (do something)
    # if view.value == "No":
    # (do something)

        child.disabled = True # making all the components on the message disabled
      await self.message.edit(content="Timeout exceeded!", view=self) # if you want, you can pass in 'embed=None' to make sure that the message edits itself with no embed.

    async def interaction_check(self, interaction: discord.Interaction) -> bool: # you have to retuen this as a bool object or it wont work
      if interaction.user != self.author: # accessing the discord.User object we set earlier
